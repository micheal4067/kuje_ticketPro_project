        <h1>Records</h1>

        
        <p>
          The <strong>Records Module</strong> provides a complete history of vehicle movements and staff activities within the TicketPro system.  
          It is divided into six major sections: <em>Admission Records</em> and <em>Exit Records</em>, <em>staff shift Records</em>, <em>Sales Records</em>, <em>Entry & Exit Barrier Access Records</em> all of which ensure transparency, accountability, and traceability.
        </p>
      
        <section>
          <h2><i class="fa fa-car-side"></i> Admission Records</h2>
          <p>
            Admission Records capture every vehicle that enters the facility. Each record logs the 
            <strong>vehicle type</strong>, <strong>card number</strong>, <strong>entry date and time</strong>, 
            <strong>entry gate</strong>, and the <strong>operator</strong> who admitted the vehicle.
          </p>

          <h3>Key Features</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Filtering:</strong> Administrators can filter by entity, date range, and vehicle type.</li>
            <li><strong>Grouping:</strong> Records are grouped by day for easy navigation.</li>
            <li><strong>Pagination:</strong> Each page shows one day's admissions to prevent overload.</li>
            <li><strong>Summary:</strong> At the bottom, a summary shows total admissions by vehicle type and overall count.</li>
            <li><strong>Export:</strong> Records can be exported as clean PDF reports for auditing and management use.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Purpose</h3>
          <p>
            This module helps ensure accurate tracking of all vehicles that entered the facility. 
            It assists with reconciling daily sales, verifying operator performance, and providing proof of entry.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2><i class="fa fa-sign-out-alt"></i> Exit Records</h2>
          <p>
            Exit Records log every vehicle that leaves the facility. This includes details such as 
            <strong>vehicle type</strong>, <strong>card number</strong>, <strong>exit date and time</strong>, 
            <strong>exit gate</strong>, and the <strong>operator</strong> who authorized the exit.
          </p>

          <h3>Key Features</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Filtering:</strong> Supports filtering by entity, date range, and vehicle type for precise queries.</li>
            <li><strong>Grouping:</strong> Just like admissions, exit records are grouped by day for clarity.</li>
            <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Ensures that only vehicles with valid admission records are exited.</li>
            <li><strong>Export:</strong> Reports can be exported to PDF for auditing and regulatory checks.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Purpose</h3>
          <p>
            This module provides assurance that all vehicles exited lawfully after payment and entry verification.  
            It strengthens security, prevents fraud, and provides full traceability of every vehicle that has used the facility.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Combined Use -->
        <section>
          <h2>How Admission & Exit Records Work Together</h2>
          <p>
            Both modules are tightly connected. A vehicle’s <em>admission record</em> is cross-checked against its 
            <em>exit record</em> to ensure balance.  
            Administrators can quickly detect anomalies such as vehicles that entered but never exited, or attempted exits without valid admission.
          </p>
        </section>

         <section>
    <h2><i class="fas fa-receipt"></i> Sales Records</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>Sales Records</strong> page provides detailed tracking of all vehicle sales across
      entities. Records are grouped <strong>by date</strong> and can be filtered by:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Entity</strong> – Admins see all, Managers see assigned entity.</li>
      <li><strong>Operator</strong> – Filter sales by the operator who issued the ticket.</li>
      <li><strong>Payment Option</strong> – Cash or POS, stored in <code>payment_option</code> column.</li>
      <li><strong>Date Range</strong> – Specific start and end dates.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each entry displays receipt number, vehicle details, operator name, entity, payment option,
      and time. Pagination groups results by day, with totals summarized at the bottom.
    </p>
    <div class="note">
      Export is available in PDF format, with headers and summaries matching other reports.
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2><i class="fas fa-user-clock"></i> Staff Shifts Record</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>Staff Shift Record</strong> page displays login and logout activity of operators
      across different entities. Records are grouped by <strong>date</strong> and support filters for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Entity</strong> – Access controlled by role.</li>
      <li><strong>Operator</strong> – Select from active operators.</li>
      <li><strong>Date Range</strong> – To view shifts in a specific period.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each record includes operator name, assigned entity, login time, logout time,
      and duration of the shift. Pagination ensures one day’s records per page.
    </p>
    <div class="note">
      Shift records can also be <strong>exported</strong> to PDF for reporting.
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2><i class="fas fa-door-open"></i> Entry Barrier Access Record</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>Entry Barrier Access</strong> page shows log attempts at entry gates.
      It tracks whether access attempts succeeded or failed, recording the gate,
      operator, trigger type, and related receipt.
    </p>
    <h3>Features:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Role-based access</strong> – Admins can view all entities, Managers/Park Officers only their assigned one.</li>
      <li><strong>Filters</strong> – By date, trigger type (manual/auto), operator, and receipt number.</li>
      <li><strong>Logs</strong> – Includes timestamp, gate, status, message, operator, and entity.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Results are grouped by date, with “see more” functionality to progressively load
      10 records at a time. This prevents long pages and improves performance.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2><i class="fas fa-traffic-light"></i> Exit Barrier Access Record</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>Exit Barrier Access</strong> page works similarly to Entry Barrier Access,
      but tracks logs from the <strong>exit gates</strong> (<code>Exit #1</code> and <code>Exit #2</code>).
    </p>
    <h3>Key Details:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Access Control</strong> – Admins may filter by entity or view all. Managers/Park Officers are restricted to their assigned entity.</li>
      <li><strong>Date Handling</strong> – By default, records are grouped daily. Admins and Managers can also select a date range.</li>
      <li><strong>Filters</strong> – 
        <ul>
          <li>Trigger type (<code>manual</code> or <code>auto</code>)</li>
          <li>Operator</li>
          <li>Receipt Number</li>
          <li>Date Range</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Logs Displayed</strong> – Each record shows receipt number (if auto), gate, operator, entity, trigger type, status (success/error), and time.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Daily Grouping & Pagination</h3>
    <p>
      Logs are grouped by date with a styled header for readability. Each day starts
      by showing 10 records. The <strong>“See More” button</strong> fetches additional logs from database.
    </p>
    <div class="note">
      Status values are color-coded: <span style="color:green;">green = success</span>,
      <span style="color:red;">red = failure</span>. Manual triggers are labeled with a 🔧 icon,
      automatic with ⚙️.
